# Clicky - Agent Instructions

<!-- This is the single source of truth for all AI coding agents. CLAUDE.md is a symlink to this file. -->

## Overview

macOS companion app. Lives in both the macOS status bar and the Dock. Clicking the menu bar icon opens a custom floating panel with companion voice controls. Clicking the Dock icon opens the Clicky chat window — a multi-conversation text-chat UI with a sidebar for managing conversations. Each conversation has its own message history; voice exchanges go into the active conversation. Uses push-to-talk (ctrl+option) to capture voice input, transcribes it via AssemblyAI streaming, and sends the transcript + a screenshot of the user's screen to Claude. Claude responds with text (streamed via SSE) and voice (ElevenLabs TTS). A blue cursor overlay can fly to and point at UI elements Claude references on any connected monitor.

All API keys live on a Cloudflare Worker proxy — nothing sensitive ships in the app.

## Architecture

- **App Type**: Menu bar + Dock (`LSUIElement=false`). The status item opens the voice panel; the Dock icon opens the chat window.
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (macOS native) with AppKit bridging for menu bar panel and cursor overlay
- **Pattern**: MVVM with `@StateObject` / `@Published` state management
- **AI Chat**: Claude (Sonnet 4.6 default, Opus 4.6 optional) via Cloudflare Worker proxy with SSE streaming
- **Speech-to-Text**: AssemblyAI real-time streaming (`u3-rt-pro` model) via websocket, with OpenAI, Apple Speech, and Parakeet (on-device, via FluidAudio/CoreML) as options. Selectable at runtime via the panel UI.
- **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs (`eleven_flash_v2_5` model) via Cloudflare Worker proxy, or Supertonic (on-device ONNX, 66M params, ~167× realtime on Apple Silicon). Selectable at runtime via the panel UI.
- **Screen Capture**: ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 14.2+), multi-monitor support
- **Voice Input**: Push-to-talk via `AVAudioEngine` + pluggable transcription-provider layer. System-wide keyboard shortcut via listen-only CGEvent tap.
- **Element Pointing**: Claude embeds `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in responses. The overlay parses these, maps coordinates to the correct monitor, and animates the blue cursor along a bezier arc to the target.
- **Concurrency**: `@MainActor` isolation, async/await throughout
- **Analytics**: PostHog via `ClickyAnalytics.swift`

### API Proxy (Cloudflare Worker)

The app never calls external APIs directly. All requests go through a Cloudflare Worker (`worker/src/index.ts`) that holds the real API keys as secrets.

| Route | Upstream | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `POST /chat` | `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` | Claude vision + streaming chat |
| `POST /tts` | `api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voiceId}` | ElevenLabs TTS audio |
| `POST /transcribe-token` | `streaming.assemblyai.com/v3/token` | Fetches a short-lived (480s) AssemblyAI websocket token |

Worker secrets: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
Worker vars: `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Menu Bar Panel Pattern**: The companion panel uses `NSStatusItem` for the menu bar icon and a custom borderless `NSPanel` for the floating control panel. This gives full control over appearance (dark, rounded corners, custom shadow) and avoids the standard macOS menu/popover chrome. The panel is non-activating so it doesn't steal focus. A global event monitor auto-dismisses it on outside clicks.

**Cursor Overlay**: A full-screen transparent `NSPanel` hosts the blue cursor companion. It's non-activating, joins all Spaces, and never steals focus. The cursor position, response text, waveform, and pointing animations all render in this overlay via SwiftUI through `NSHostingView`.

**Global Push-To-Talk Shortcut**: Background push-to-talk uses a listen-only `CGEvent` tap instead of an AppKit global monitor so modifier-based shortcuts like `ctrl + option` are detected more reliably while the app is running in the background.

**Shared URLSession for AssemblyAI**: A single long-lived `URLSession` is shared across all AssemblyAI streaming sessions (owned by the provider, not the session). Creating and invalidating a URLSession per session corrupts the OS connection pool and causes "Socket is not connected" errors after a few rapid reconnections.

**Transient Cursor Mode**: When "Show Clicky" is off, pressing the hotkey fades in the cursor overlay for the duration of the interaction (recording → response → TTS → optional pointing), then fades it out automatically after 1 second of inactivity.

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `leanring_buddyApp.swift` | ~100 | App entry point. `CompanionAppDelegate` creates `MenuBarPanelManager`, `ChatWindowController`, and `CompanionManager`. Implements `applicationShouldHandleReopen` to open the chat window on Dock icon click. |
| `ChatWindowController.swift` | ~65 | Manages the Clicky chat NSWindow. Created lazily on first dock-icon click; kept alive after closing so conversation persists across sessions. Hosts `ChatContainerView` (sidebar + chat). |
| `ChatContainerView.swift` | ~100 | Root view for the chat window. NavigationSplitView with toggleable sidebar and detail column that swaps between ChatView and ChatSettingsView. Toolbar: sidebar toggle, new chat, model name, gear icon. |

| `ChatView.swift` | ~300 | SwiftUI chat window UI. Scrollable message list with user/assistant bubbles, streaming typing indicator, markdown rendering, and a text input bar. Observes `companionManager.chatMessages` for the active conversation. |
| `ChatMessage.swift` | ~45 | Model for a single chat message. `role` (.user/.assistant), `content` (var for streaming), `timestamp`, `source` (.voice/.text). |
| `Conversation.swift` | ~45 | Model for a conversation. `id`, `title` (auto-generated from first message), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `messageCount`. Used by the sidebar and ConversationStore. |
| `ConversationStore.swift` | ~300 | Multi-conversation persistence. Stores each conversation's messages in a separate JSON file under `conversations/`, maintains a lightweight index for the sidebar, handles migration from the legacy single `history.json`, and manages screenshot compression/storage. |
| `CompanionManager.swift` | ~1700 | Central state machine. Owns dictation, shortcut monitoring, screen capture, Claude API, LM Studio API, ElevenLabs TTS, Supertonic TTS, overlay management, and multi-conversation state. Tracks voice state, conversation history, model selection, TTS/STT provider selection, active conversation, and `chatMessages`. Coordinates the push-to-talk → screenshot → LLM → TTS → pointing pipeline and the text-chat → LLM → streaming pipeline. Handles NOTE/action tag parsing via `parseAndStripNoteTags` and `executeActionTags`. Provides conversation switching, creation, and deletion for the sidebar. |
| `MenuBarPanelManager.swift` | ~243 | NSStatusItem + custom NSPanel lifecycle. Creates the menu bar icon, manages the floating companion panel (show/hide/position), installs click-outside-to-dismiss monitor. |
| `CompanionPanelView.swift` | ~1200 | SwiftUI panel content for the menu bar dropdown. Shows companion status, push-to-talk instructions, model picker (Sonnet/Opus/LM Studio/Local), gear icon settings panel (API keys, LM Studio model dropdown, TTS/STT pickers), permissions UI, DM feedback button, and quit button. Dark aesthetic using `DS` design system. |

| `BuddyTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~100 | Protocol surface and provider factory for voice transcription backends. Resolves provider based on `VoiceTranscriptionProvider` in Info.plist — AssemblyAI, OpenAI, or Apple Speech. |
| `AssemblyAIStreamingTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~478 | Streaming transcription provider. Fetches temp tokens from the Cloudflare Worker, opens an AssemblyAI v3 websocket, streams PCM16 audio, tracks turn-based transcripts, and delivers finalized text on key-up. Shares a single URLSession across all sessions. |
| `OpenAIAudioTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~317 | Upload-based transcription provider. Buffers push-to-talk audio locally, uploads as WAV on release, returns finalized transcript. |
| `AppleSpeechTranscriptionProvider.swift` | ~147 | Local fallback transcription provider backed by Apple's Speech framework. |
| `BuddyAudioConversionSupport.swift` | ~108 | Audio conversion helpers. Converts live mic buffers to PCM16 mono audio and builds WAV payloads for upload-based providers. |

| `ClaudeAPI.swift` | ~291 | Claude vision API client with streaming (SSE) and non-streaming modes. TLS warmup optimization, image MIME detection, conversation history support. |
| `OpenAIAPI.swift` | ~245 | OpenAI-compatible vision API client. Non-streaming and streaming (SSE) modes. Used for LM Studio local models at 127.0.0.1:1234 and OpenAI cloud. |
| `ElevenLabsTTSClient.swift` | ~81 | ElevenLabs TTS client. Sends text to the Worker proxy, plays back audio via `AVAudioPlayer`. Exposes `isPlaying` for transient cursor scheduling. |
| `MusicController.swift` | ~115 | System-wide music control via media key simulation (NX_KEYTYPE_PLAY/FAST/REWIND). Works with Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, and any app holding media focus — no app-specific API needed. Also reads `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` so Claude can answer "what's playing?" and the current track is injected into the system prompt. Handles `[MUSIC:play|pause|toggle|next|prev]` tags. |
| `SupertonicTTSClient.swift` | ~160 | On-device TTS client backed by Supertonic ONNX (66M params, ~167× realtime). Auto-downloads models from HuggingFace on first use. Mirrors `ElevenLabsTTSClient` interface. |

| `UserProfile.swift` | ~70 | User personal context card — nickname, goals, additional context. Persisted to UserDefaults as JSON. Prepended to every Claude system prompt so responses are always personalized. |
| `LearningLog.swift` | ~165 | Append-only learning log. `LearningEntry` (Codable: app, topic, date, noteTitle) stored as JSON at `~/Library/Application Support/Clicky/learning/log.json`. `LearningLogStore` handles append, delete, filter-by-app, recent entries, and `buildContextSummary` for quiz/recall injection. |
| `ActionTagParser.swift` | ~240 | Unified parser for all action tags Claude can embed in responses: `[LOG:app:topic]`, `[OPEN:url-or-app]`, `[SHORTCUT:name]`, `[REMIND:text:date-hint]`, `[MUSIC:action]`, `[CLICK:x,y:label:screenN]`. Returns `ParsedActionTags` with cleaned text and extracted actions. NOTE tags are stripped upstream by `CompanionManager.parseAndStripNoteTags` before this runs. |
| `ActionExecutor.swift` | ~166 | Executes actions extracted by `ActionTagParser`. `openURLOrApp` uses NSWorkspace (bundle-ID lookup → name search → CLI fallback). `runShortcut` shells out to `shortcuts run`. `createReminder` uses NSAppleScript to Reminders.app. All actions run on background queues and never block TTS or UI. |
| `DesignSystem.swift` | ~880 | Design system tokens — colors, corner radii, shared styles. All UI references `DS.Colors`, `DS.CornerRadius`, etc. |
| `KeychainHelper.swift` | ~95 | Minimal Keychain wrapper for secure API key storage. Handles save/load/delete and one-time migration from UserDefaults. |

| `AppBundleConfiguration.swift` | ~28 | Runtime configuration reader for keys stored in the app bundle Info.plist. |
| `worker/src/index.ts` | ~142 | Cloudflare Worker proxy. Three routes: `/chat` (Claude), `/tts` (ElevenLabs), `/transcribe-token` (AssemblyAI temp token). |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj

# Select the leanring-buddy scheme, set signing team, Cmd+R to build and run

# Known non-blocking warnings: Swift 6 concurrency warnings,
# deprecated onChange warning in OverlayWindow.swift. Do NOT attempt to fix these.
```

### Required Swift Packages (add via Xcode → File → Add Package Dependencies)

| Package | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| onnxruntime-swift-package-manager | `https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-swift-package-manager.git` | ONNX Runtime for Supertonic on-device TTS |
| FluidAudio | `https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio.git` | Parakeet CoreML models for on-device ASR |

After adding, link both products to the `leanring-buddy` target. Supertonic downloads ~200MB of ONNX model files from HuggingFace on first use. Parakeet downloads ~600MB of CoreML models on first use. Both are cached in `~/Library/Application Support/Clicky/models/`.

**Do NOT run `xcodebuild` from the terminal** — it invalidates TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions and the app will need to re-request screen recording, accessibility, etc.

## Code Style & Conventions

### Variable and Method Naming

IMPORTANT: Follow these naming rules strictly. Clarity is the top priority.

- Be as clear and specific with variable and method names as possible
- **Optimize for clarity over concision.** A developer with zero context on the codebase should immediately understand what a variable or method does just from reading its name
- Use longer names when it improves clarity. Do NOT use single-character variable names
- Example: use `originalQuestionLastAnsweredDate` instead of `originalAnswered`
- When passing props or arguments to functions, keep the same names as the original variable. Do not shorten or abbreviate parameter names. If you have `currentCardData`, pass it as `currentCardData`, not `card` or `cardData`

### Code Clarity

- **Clear is better than clever.** Do not write functionality in fewer lines if it makes the code harder to understand
- Write more lines of code if additional lines improve readability and comprehension
- Make things so clear that someone with zero context would completely understand the variable names, method names, what things do, and why they exist
- When a variable or method name alone cannot fully explain something, add a comment explaining what is happening and why

### Swift/SwiftUI Conventions

- Use SwiftUI for all UI unless a feature is only supported in AppKit (e.g., `NSPanel` for floating windows)
- All UI state updates must be on `@MainActor`
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what", especially for non-obvious AppKit bridging
- AppKit `NSPanel`/`NSWindow` bridged into SwiftUI via `NSHostingView`
- All buttons must show a pointer cursor on hover
- For any interactive element, explicitly think through its hover behavior (cursor, visual feedback, and whether hover should communicate clickability)

### Do NOT

- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change
- Do not try to fix the known non-blocking warnings (Swift 6 concurrency, deprecated onChange)
- Do not rename the project directory or scheme (the "leanring" typo is intentional/legacy)
- Do not run `xcodebuild` from the terminal — it invalidates TCC permissions

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise, explain the "why" not the "what"
- Do not force-push to main
